Hey Sit down and listen and they'll tell you when you're wrong
Eradicate but vindicate as "progress" creeps along
Puritan work ethic maintains its subconscious edge
As old glory maintains your consciousness
There's a loser in the house and a puppet on a stool
And a crowded way of life and a black reflecting pool
And as the people bend the moral fabric dies
Then country can't pretend to ignore it's people's cries
You are the government 
You are the volition
You are jurisdiction
And I make a difference too

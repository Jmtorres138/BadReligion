See there's a girl who's afraid of the world 
So she stays at home
Next there's a boy who seems so lost in his joy
He's all alone
The cameras on them 
They're in the land of competition
Southern California air feeds them 
And they know they're the best
'Cuz of the way they are dressed
But you can bet you are not welcome in their home
See there's a girl who sits and watches the world from her blue screen
Also a boy who truly wants to destroy his hometown scene
They both want to travel to the land of competition
Southern California will destroy them 
And they won't be the best they'll be
The poseurs who dress like the plastic idiots who they copy
Tell me what do you need to make you happy?
Indeed, is it out of your reach?
Beware of number one
See all the damage it has done
There are so few of them 
You won't find too many in the land of competition
Southern California doesn't breed them
If you just want the best turn to yourself for the rest
And forget about the ones who "Have It All"
